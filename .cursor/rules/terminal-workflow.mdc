# Terminal & Directory Workflow

## Critical Directory Rule
**ALWAYS navigate to the correct project directory first:**
```bash
cd /c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck
```

## Why This Is Critical
- The bash_profile automatically redirects to a different directory
- Many commands will fail silently if executed from wrong directory
- npm workspace commands require being in the root directory
- File operations need correct relative paths

## Essential Commands Pattern
Every terminal session should start with:
```bash
cd /c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck
# Then execute your commands
npm run dev
# or
cd frontend && npm install some-package
# or  
cd backend && npm run build
```

## Directory Structure Navigation
- **Root**: `/c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck` - For workspace commands
- **Frontend**: `/c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck/frontend` - For frontend-specific tasks
- **Backend**: `/c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck/backend` - For backend-specific tasks
- **Shared**: `/c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck/shared` - For shared logic

## Terminal Issues on Windows
- The terminal may show bash prompt errors (safe to ignore)
- Some commands may not work due to bash_profile configuration
- Always verify you're in the correct directory with `pwd`
- Use full paths when in doubt

## Verification Commands
- `pwd` - Check current directory
- `ls` - List contents to confirm location  
- `cd /c/work/workspaces/TeraDeck && pwd` - Navigate and confirm
